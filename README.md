# JK.bat

## The JK.bat

I save all of the batch animations that still work on cmd on this bat file.
You can active them all at once by using the batch as it is, 
it will lag your pc if you do it several times (Have fun with it) :D

This was made for fun only.

## The JK2.bat

It is desing to be edited in amount of reps an overcharge the cpu of a computer if it keeps on running.
Have fun.

## The JK3.bat

It is a mix of JK and JK2, uses the animations from JK and randomly uses one for each window it opens.
An also, can edit to chosse the amount of windows created on variable "reps" like JK 2

## The nuke.bat

Its a fake nuke menu (kind of) made for fun. :D

## The OVERRIDE

Fun menu, with a lot of stuff there
