# JK.bat

## The JK.bat

I save all of the batch animations that still work on cmd on this bat file.
You can active them all at once by using the batch as it is, 
it will lag your pc if you do it several times (Have fun with it) :D

This was made for fun only.

## The JK2.bat

It is desing to be edited an overcharge the cpu of a computer if it keeps on running.
Have fun.
